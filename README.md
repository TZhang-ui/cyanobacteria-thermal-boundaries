# cyanobacteria-thermal-boundaries
This repository accompanies the study “Thermal boundaries and underlying systems biology mechanisms in two water-bloom cyanobacteria”. It provides processed transcriptomic and lipidomic datasets, experimental measurements, and GECKO-based enzyme-constrained metabolic models for Dolichospermum sp. and Microcystis aeruginosa.
